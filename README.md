# Xmegasort
The set of algorithms for sorting the elements of array in ascending order.
- **InsertionSort**   
Is a simple sorting algorithm that is relatively efficient for small lists and mostly sorted lists, and is often used as part of more sophisticated algorithms.
- **HeapSort**    
Is a much more efficient version of selection sort. It also works by determining the largest (or smallest) element of the list, placing that at the end (or beginning) of the list, then continuing with the rest of the list, but accomplishes this task efficiently by using a data structure called a heap, a special type of binary tree.
- **QuickSort**   
Is a divide and conquer algorithm which relies on a partition operation: to partition an array, an element called a pivot is selected. All elements smaller than the pivot are moved before it and all greater elements are moved after it. This can be done efficiently in linear time and in-place. The lesser and greater sublists are then recursively sorted.
- **QuickSortIns**    
Is a custom quicksort, accelerated by InsertionSort.
- **QuickSortX**    
Is a custom quicksort with Async work and accelerated by InsertionSort.
- **MergeSort**   
Merge sort takes advantage of the ease of merging already sorted lists into a new sorted list.
- **MergeSortAsync**    
Is a custom mergesort with Async work
